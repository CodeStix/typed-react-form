A fast, completely type-checked React form builder, focussed on typescript integration and minimal rerenders. Featuring:

- [Object fields](https://typed-react-form.codestix.nl/docs/Object-fields)
- [Array fields](https://typed-react-form.codestix.nl/docs/Array-fields)
- [Validation](https://typed-react-form.codestix.nl/docs/Validation)
- [Easily toggle fields](https://typed-react-form.codestix.nl/docs/Toggling-a-field)
- [Listeners (subscription based state updates)](https://typed-react-form.codestix.nl/docs/useListener)

**All of this while keeping type-checking!**

## Install

```  
npm install typed-react-form
```

## [Documentation here](https://typed-react-form.codestix.nl/)

## Javascript/typescript React

This library is built from the ground up for React with typescript, but it also works with with vanilla React, without enforced type checking.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

1. Clone this repo
2. Install deps using `yarn`. Yarn is required because of the resolutions field in package.json, npm does not support this.
3. Open a new terminal and navigate to `example/`, run `yarn` and `yarn start` to start the testing application.
4. Done! When you edit source code, it will be rebuilt and update the testing application.
